CocoaConcurrency
================

Examples of concurrency with Cocoa (and related libraries) from the ground up

## Resources
- [Threading Programming Guide (Apple)](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/Introduction/Introduction.html) If you pick one link, pick this. Read all of it and follow all of the links. It'll take you a while and that's okay.
- [Mastering Threads on Mac OS X (Dr. Dobb's)](http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/mastering-threads-on-macos-x/232602177) Some quick examples with POSIX threads and NSThreads
- [The App Launch Sequence on iOS (Ole Begemann)](http://oleb.net/blog/2011/06/app-launch-sequence-ios/) This article isn't directly relevant to concurrency, but I found it while looking into run loops and might help bridge understanding of small examples to an actual iOS or Mac app.
